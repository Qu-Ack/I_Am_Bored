# I_Am_Bored

Hello, 

This is a project that is more inclined towards the fun side rather than the learning side. I got pretty bored doing my webdev course so I decided to make something cool with the new fetch concept that I have learned. 

App will be called `I AM BORED`

**T**his app will contain a button which on press will give you an activity to do. **VERY** BASIC application but fun. As you can tell from the brief description that the javascript code is not going to be that complex therefore I will work on the design on this one try to make it as interactive as possible.
