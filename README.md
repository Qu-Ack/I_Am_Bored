# I_Am_Bored

Hello, 

This is a project that is more inclined towards the fun side rather than the learning side. I got pretty bored doing my webdev course so I decided to make something cool with the new fetch concept that I have learned. 

App will be called `I AM BORED`

**T**his app will contain a button which on press will give you an activity to do. **VERY** BASIC application but fun. As you can tell from the brief description that the javascript code is not going to be that complex therefore I will work on the design on this one try to make it as interactive as possible. 


If I am being honest I thought that this idea would be all over the internet. I thought maybe 30 , 40 websites will be dedicated to this sole idea but I WAS WRONG. I can't find a single website that will just give me a task. Maybe I am onto something. MAYBE I WILL BECOME THE NEXT JEFF BEZOS BUT I WILL HAVE TO ARRANGE A BARBER. 


we will use progress bars for telling the details about the activity
